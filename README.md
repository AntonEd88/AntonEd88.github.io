# A Letter to 18-Year Old Me From 2021 Me

## Dear Edwin,

It’s me… you… us… I’m you in 2021. So much has happened in the last *cough cough* years and I just want to give you some advice that I think we could’ve used as a young adult. Advice I wish I had at your age. Not going to spoil what happens in your 20s and beyond, but keep these things in the back of your head.

This may not make sense now but when you sign up for your social accounts (think MySpace but better) embrace your name. Sign up once you hear of that platform. You may not be into it at first, but you have no creativity when it comes to usernames. You still cringe at the thought of your original AOL Instant Messenger screen name. 

You have so much going on for you and I hope that you can see your potential. Believe in yourself because others believe in you. 

Take care of yourself. Know you did the right thing when it came to your mental health. It’s not linear, it’s not easy, but you have the support system there and know that you made a difference by opening up to others, especially when the topic is taboo within the Asian American Pacific Islander communities. 

Embrace yourself. You’re learning about your cultural identity right now and still trying to understand who you are. You’ll learn to love yourself and your identities. It’ll be a little later in life, but you love you. I love you. Keep that embedded in your brain please.

While you’re learning to embrace your Filipino-American cultural identity, don’t forget about food! I know you have this strict “don’t buy Filipino food when you know your mom can cook better” attitude, but start learning some of the recipes! Mom’s ube halaya is SO FREAKING GOOD. I know you’ve seen her prepare it…

### UBE HALAYA
_Ingredients_
- 1 package of frozen UBE (thaw before use)
- 2 cans of Thai coconut milk (Not that gross Americanized watered-down boxed stuff) 
- 1 stick of butter
- 1 cup of powdered sugar
  
  - Take a can of coconut milk and dump it in a small pot on medium-low heat. Stir it from time-to-time until it reduces into a brown-caramelized solid curd-like structure. You’ll smell the coconut and know when it’s ready.
  - In a non-stick pan melt the butter, then add the packaged ube, can of coconut milk and sugar. Stir and mix until everything is incorporated. The ube will have a thick consistency so get ready to workout those arms!
  - When everything is finished. Plate the ube for presentation and add the coconut milk crumbles on top.
  - Remember that this is a dense, sweet and savory dessert so a little goes a long way so make sure the coconut crumble is spreadout evenly.

Ube latte… it’s your idea. Keep thinking it’s _your_ original idea.

Dude… it was easy! And chicken adobo?

### CHICKEN ADOBO
_Ingredients_
- Chicken Thighs & Drumsticks
- 1:1 Soy Sauce to Vinegar (enough to marinate chicken)
- 1 Onion, chopped
- Few cloves of garlic, chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- Whole peppercorn
- Cooking oil

  - In a resealable bag, mix chicken with soy sauce, vinegar, half the onion and garlic, some peppercorn. Marinate for 30 minutes to a few hours.
  - Add a splash of cooking oil into your pan on medium heat, add rest of the onions and garlic until aromatic, but not burnt. 
  - Add chicken skin side down and flip when ready. 
  - Add left over marinade w/ some water and add bay leaves. 
  - Simmer until cooked. Serve with rice.

I know high school wasn’t super traditional for us but the rest of your education won’t be as well. You’ll know where we’re going for college in a few weeks. Right now you’re doubting your healthcare career and that’s okay. Your gut already knows what you want to do your undergrad in. It’ll make sense by around Spring 2020 and hopefully things will fall into place by 2022.

Speaking of 2020…
- be thankful you’re from Seattle. You’re very lucky you learned about Civil Rights in elementary school. The 1960’s may have seemed like a long time ago for you, but trust me when I say that it’s a lot closer to your time than you think.
- keep listening to science. The running joke that all Americans are stupid? We are. I’ll confirm that.
- being an introvert will come in handy.
- learn to clip and use coupons. Stock up on non-perishable foods, toiletries, and toilet paper. It’ll come handy in about 14 years.
- keep joking about the end of the world. Remember when you thought 2000 already happened in 1996? The Mayans may have gotten their calendars wrong too.
- cherish every hug you give loved ones. Apparently that ain’t gonna happen for about two years and will be frowned upon for a few months. (It’ll make sense later)

Last piece of advice I can give you? ***Don’t forget to tell your friends and family that you love them every chance you get.***

I love you,

Edwin (me) (you) (you in 2021)
